gemtext2latex
=============

This is a trivial tool for converting text in Gemini format to LaTeX. It assumes the presence of a minimal LaTeX class called "mk-plain".

The tool simply reads Gemini text on stdin and emits a reasonable LaTeX document.

To do
-----

* remove dependence on "mk-plain"
* provide docs
* tidy up the code
* sort out relative URLs / base URLs
