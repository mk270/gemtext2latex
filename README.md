gemtext2latex
=============

This is a trivial tool for converting text in Gemini format to LaTeX. It assumes the presence of a minimal LaTeX class called `mk-plain`.

The tool simply reads Gemini text on stdin and emits a reasonable LaTeX document, which in turn can produce a reasonable PDF via `pdflatex`.
